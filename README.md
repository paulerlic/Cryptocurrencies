# Cryptocurrencies Analysis

### Overview

We are creating a report for cyrpto currencies that are currently trading on the market, and we will try to show how they can be grouped using a classification system for new investments. We need to process the dataset so that it fits the machine learning model. We will be employing an unsupervised learning clustering algorithim to group the differnt cryptos, our results will be shared with visualizations. 




Analysis Steps:
1. Preprocessing Data for Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
2. Reducing Data Dimensions with PCA.
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies with K-means.
4. Visualizing the esults.
